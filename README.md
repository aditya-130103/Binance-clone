Built with
HTML5
CSS3
BootStrap

I created a website using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap by following these steps:
- I downloaded Bootstrap 4 from getbootstrap.com and copied the JS and CSS files to my HTML directory.
- I linked the Bootstrap CSS file and added core Bootstrap JavaScript to my HTML file using the <link> and <script> tags.
- I used the Bootstrap grid system to create a responsive layout for my website with rows and columns.
- I added a navigation bar, a jumbotron, a footer and some content to my website using Bootstrap components and custom CSS.
- I tested my website on different devices and browsers to ensure it looked good and worked well.
